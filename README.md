## Dozer Bean Mapper
This project demonstrates bean mapping using [Dozer](https://github.com/DozerMapper/dozer).

This is a stripped down skeletonized version of the original project due to policies and agreements.

As I noticed working with Dozer, it lags behind in [performance](https://www.baeldung.com/java-performance-mapping-frameworks) when compared with other java mapping frameworks like MapStruct, Orika and JMapper. However, due to its simplicity and less maintenance requirements, it can be used when performance is not the main concern. 


### Requirements
- Java 17
- Spring Boot
- Gradle
